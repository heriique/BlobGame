ideas:

to draw blob, need:

  map of distance to edge
    with opengl, hopefully
    for every point, compute dist to all
    edges, then pick lowest value or weighted avg of closest 2 or all.
	triangulate points, then phong shade the mesh

  fragment inside or outside blob
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25463015/black-out-everything-outside-a-polygon
  draw color for all inside fragments, lighter
  near edge
  later: find dist to edge in direction of light source, add spec lighting

  pointy edge: instead of adding particles, add points to hull and smoothen
    -is shrinking a problem? can have particles outside edge?

make hullfinder3 with only convex hull and b2Vec2
